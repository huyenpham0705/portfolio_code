# Dealing with Creative Block in Designing.

Published on: 2025-11-02

Creative block happens to everyone in creative fields - especially designers. Here’s how I navigate it:

## 1. Brainstorm Without Boundaries

When I hit a wall, I start by jotting down every keyword or idea that comes to mind - no matter how random. I branch out from each word to explore new directions. Talking to others, even outside the design world, often sparks fresh perspectives. If a conversation gives me new keywords or angles, it’s working!

## 2. Go Analog: Sketch It Out

Stepping away from the screen helps. I grab a pencil and sketch freely. The tactile process often unlocks ideas that feel more organic and less forced.

## 3. Seek Inspiration

I turn to curated platforms to reignite my creativity:
- Graphic Design & Illustration: Behance, Dribbble, Pinterest
- Web Design: Winning Websites
These sites showcase diverse styles and innovative approaches that often spark new ideas.

## 4. Watch “Abstract: The Art of Design”

This Netflix series (also available on YouTube) profiles designers across disciplines. Their stories are deeply relatable and motivating. It reminds me that creative struggles are part of the process - and that breakthroughs often follow.

## 5. Take a Break

When my thoughts feel tangled, I pause. A walk, a nap, or simply stepping away helps reset my mind. Breaks create space for fresh ideas to surface and old patterns to dissolve.
