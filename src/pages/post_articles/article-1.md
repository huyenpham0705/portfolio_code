# How Joining Non-Profit Projects Shaped My Perspective on Design.

My first exposure to design came through student organizations - an experience that revealed both its challenges and rewards.

## Design Is Not Just Individuality - It’s Unity

Each organization had its own visual identity and design guidelines. As a new member of the design team, I quickly learned that design isn’t just about personal expression - it’s about cohesion. Every media post had to align with the organization’s style, and I struggled at first to adapt my ideas to fit a unified aesthetic.

To overcome this, I began studying existing designs more closely - breaking down elements, analyzing details, and learning how to replicate a style without losing clarity. Gradually, I developed the ability to design within a framework while still contributing creatively.

Collaboration was another key lesson. When working on a multi-image media post with other designers, communication became essential. We had to coordinate closely to ensure the final product looked consistent - as if created by one person.

## Design Is Not Pure Freedom - It’s Problem Solving

Initially, I assumed the design team leader had creative freedom. But when I stepped into that role, I realized how wrong I was.

I had to coordinate with the content lead, PR lead, and heads of the organization. Every decision - style, mascot, profile picture, audience targeting - was debated endlessly. Launching a new season meant navigating constant feedback, conflicting opinions, and tight deadlines.

Post-launch, new challenges emerged: unclear briefs, misaligned timelines, inconsistent execution. I had to create detailed styleboards, guide team members, and prevent burnout - all while maintaining quality and consistency.

## Design Isn’t Flawless Freedom—But It’s Still My Passion

Friends and family warned me that design as a job might feel different - less enjoyable, more stressful. And they were right in some ways. It’s not always fun. It’s full of revisions, criticism, and constraints.

But despite the pressure, I found clarity. These experiences gave me a realistic view of what design entails - and made me more certain that it’s the path I want to pursue.
